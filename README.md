# GIS and Humanities lecture

## Introduction

### Main Idea

This is meant to be a 2 hours course of GIS for humanities students. In the first half, the lecture covers the theoretical basics of cartography, map visualization with a short practical task in the second half

### Requirements

- [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/) installed
  - recommended is the STANDALONE STABLE version
- internet connection

---

## Theoretical introduction

### GIS, Cartography, Geoinformatics, Remote Sensing, Map

- **GIS**
  - ~ Geospatial
  - 1.Geographical Information SCIENCE
    - Scientific discipline
  - 2.Geographical Information SYSTEMS
    - Software | General tools - [ArcGIS](https://www.arcgis.com/index.html), [QGIS](<(https://www.qgis.org/en/site/)>)
    - Built-in systems
    - Frameworks | libraries for data manipulation, visualization...
- **Cartography**
  - "Drawing" maps of geographical space
  - more "conservative" term
- **Geoinformatics**
  - ~ Geomatics
- **Remote sensing**
  - Processing satelite images

### GIS data sources

- Two types of data
  - **Raster data**
    - Pixel based
    - Formats - png, tiff, jpg...
    - Spatially continuous information - satellite images, elevation, land cover, heatmaps
  - **Vector data**
    - Defined by coordinates | mathematically
    - Formats - shp, geojson, pdf, svg
    - Topology - points, lines, polygons
    - Spatially discrete information - points of interest, rivers | streets | borders, regions
- Layers

### Spatial Analysis

- Manipulating data to create a new dataset
- Map algebra (rasters)
- Geostatistics
-

### Visualization Basics

### Geospatial technologies

- Spatial database systems and Search Engines
- Web frameworks
- Specialized scripting libraries and tools
- Global infrastructures

### Mathematical Cartography, Geographical Coordinates

## Motivation (Why to be interested in GIS?)

### GIS + X

- Every phenomenon that relates to the geographical space
- There are many fields of human activity that are dependent on GIS.
  - Meteorology
  - Transportation
  - Ecology
  - Urban planning
  - Agriculture
    ...

### GIS (Maps) + Humanitites = Spatial Humanities (Digital Humanities)

- Long tradition of sketching maps in all kind of sciences
- Constraints preventing the full potential of using GIS in Humanities

  - Data quality (validity, uncertainty, incompleteness)
  - Preferences in qualitative approaches
  - Untrust to the generalization process ?
  - Statistical | Mathematical | Programming skills required

- Relevant practical GIS tasks in the area of Digital Humanities
  - Geocoding
  - Georeferencing
  -
